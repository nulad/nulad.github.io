# Welcome to My Blog

I'm starting fresh with a new blog design. This space will be home to my thoughts on web development, design philosophy, and occasional musings about technology.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:
- Web development with modern tools
- Design philosophy and minimalism
- Open source contributions
- Thoughts on the intersection of code and creativity

## The Design

You might notice the stark, brutalist design. It's intentional:
- Maximum readability
- Fast loading times
- No tracking or analytics
- Focus on content over chrome

## Getting Started

This first post marks the beginning of a new chapter. I have several posts in the works about Next.js, static site generation, and building for the web without the bloat.

Stay tuned for more real content coming soon!
