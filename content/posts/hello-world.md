# Hello World

This is a sample post to exercise the baseline typography and markdown rendering.

## What this post covers

- Headings and paragraph rhythm
- A [link](https://example.com) with hover/visited states
- Inline `code` and fenced code blocks
- A blockquote
- A horizontal rule

---

## Code block

```js
export function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

## Blockquote

> Brutalism is clarity: strong borders, readable type, and content-first layout.

## Closing

If you can read this on the deployed site, the content directory is wired correctly.
