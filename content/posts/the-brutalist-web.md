# The Brutalist Web

Brutalist web design embraces rawness and functionality over polish. It's a reaction against the homogeneous, overly-polished designs that dominate the modern web.

## What is Brutalism?

Originally from architecture, brutalism emphasizes:
- Raw, unfinished materials
- Exposed structure and systems
- Honest expression of function
- Rejection of decorative elements

## Brutalism in Web Design

On the web, this translates to:
- **Monospace fonts**: No hiding the fact this is digital text
- **Hard borders**: Clear delineation of elements
- **Black and white**: Maximum contrast, no pretense
- **No animations**: Content over flash
- **Visible structure**: Let the HTML show through

## Why I Chose This Style

1. **Focus on Content**: No distractions, just words
2. **Fast Loading**: No CSS frameworks, no heavy assets
3. **Timeless**: Won't look dated in 6 months
4. **Accessible**: High contrast, clear structure
5. **Different**: Stands out in a sea of similar designs

## The Philosophy

There's something honest about brutalist design. It says:
- "This is text on a screen"
- "This is a link, it's underlined"
- "This is a border, it's solid black"

No pretending buttons are made of glass. No skeuomorphic metaphors. Just the web as it is.

## Criticisms and Responses

Common criticisms:
- "It's ugly" - Beauty is subjective
- "It's hard to use" - Good UX doesn't require gradients
- "It looks broken" - Maybe our expectations are broken

## Implementing Brutalism

Key principles:
1. **Use system fonts**: Monospace for that terminal feel
2. **Black borders**: 2-3px solid borders on elements
3. **No rounded corners**: Right angles only
4. **High contrast**: Black on white, period
5. **Minimal padding**: Dense information layout

## The Future

As the web becomes more homogenized, brutalist design offers an alternative. It's not for everyone, but it's honest, fast, and puts content first.

Sometimes, less polish means more character.
